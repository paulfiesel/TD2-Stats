# TD2-Stats
 Platform that displays win rates for units and builds in the game Legion Tower Defense 2, similar to HOTSLOGS.com. The website will fetch data from the Legion TD2 API (https://swagger.legiontd2.com/), process it using Python on the backend, and present it through a user-friendly interface built with React on the frontend. The key features include displaying win rates for individual units and popular builds, offering filtering and sorting options, and providing a seamless user experience. The project objectives are to develop a robust and scalable website, ensure data accuracy, and showcase skills in Python, React, API integration, and web development.
